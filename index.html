The program includes drawing, painting, clay, construction, collage, modelling and textiles. Each class attends a fortnightly 90 minute lesson with a specialist Art teacher. Work is stored at school in a folio and that is sent home at the end of the year.  Every two years the school has an exhibition which showcases the students’ artworks. The Art department also makes props for the concert and festivals that the school takes part in.

ResourceSmart AuSSI (Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative) Victoria helps schools benefit from embedding sustainability in everything they do. The aim is to reduce costs while giving students the opportunity to learn about sustainability in a tangible and realistic environment. Viewbank Primary School is going to take action to minimise waste, save energy and water, promote biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As we achieve each module we will gain a star certification. Our aim is to become a 5 star school. This is a long term goal and one which we will be working towards for the next 5+ years.
